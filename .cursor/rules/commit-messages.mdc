# Rule: Writing commit messages

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in writing meaningful and concise commit messages.

## Guidelines

1. Messages should be no longer than 120 characters.
2. Message content should contain only the most important changes.
3. Message content does not need to include the agent's thought process.
4. Group large changesets into smaller commits based on logical appraoch.
5. Utilize gitmoji for a touch of flair and description.
